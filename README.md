Due to the requirements of our collaborating partners, we are unable to upload the entire dataset at this time.  To support research transparency and reproducibility, we will provide a curated portion of the dataset, ensuring that it includes the key experimental cases. At the same time, we welcome staff with research needs to contact us at any time, and we will provide them with assistance to the greatest extent.
