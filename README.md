Due to requests from our partners, we are currently unable to upload the entire dataset. To support transparency and reproducibility of the study, we will make a portion of the dataset available, ensuring that it includes key experimental cases. These include 400 defect images in the training set and up to 100 defect images in the validation set. At the same time, we also welcome staff with scientific research needs to contact us at any time, we will provide maximum help for them.
